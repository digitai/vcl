Voltage Controlled Light

Created by Itai Asseo // 

The purpose of this code is to support an LED strip that will communicate with a modular synth, and trigger light bursts when receiving gate signals

**features** 
* CV gate signal triggers light to go on
* You can control how long the fade is (from immediate/no fade, to infinite)
* there are 2 ways to control the color:
1. with a potentiometer knob
2. with voltage receiving 0-5v
** to select between the 2 options, there is a switch selector
